#CHARTS
React Leaflet is a library that allows you to create maps using Leaflet, a popular open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. Using React Leaflet, you can easily create maps with various features such as markers, popups, and tooltips. In the context of COVID-19 data visualization, React Leaflet can be used to create a map with markers that indicate the total number of active, recovered cases and deaths in each country. This can help to provide a visual representation of the spread of the virus and its impact on different countries.

Pie charts are a type of chart that display data in a circular graph, with each slice of the pie representing a portion of the whole. In the context of COVID-19 data visualization, a pie chart can be used to show the percentage of cases in different categories such as active, recovered, and deaths. This can help to provide a quick and easy-to-understand overview of the current state of the pandemic. Pie charts can be created using various charting libraries such as Chart.js or Recharts.
